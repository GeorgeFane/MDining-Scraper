This is v2 of my MDining Scraper app. 

v0 simply got the hours for each meal for each dining hall, which my friends helped me realize was not very useful. 
v1 got all hours, checks which meal for each dining hall is open right now, and then gets all foods for that meal. It showed all foods that you could feasibly get at this instant.
v2 has everything in v1, as well as a 'search table' for users to find which hall is serving the food they want.

This app is deployed on Heroku at https://mdining-scraper.herokuapp.com/
