This compiles the hours for all University of Michigan Dining Halls onto a single page

Admittedly, it's a very small annoyance to have to click another hall's page to see its hours, but even the smallest improvement in my way of getting food is worth the world to me. I love good eats :) . On a more serious note, this project was also an opportunity to work with web scraping. I thought I'd use an image-to-text module, similar to Google Lens, but I ended up using Beautiful Soup, an HTML parser.

I've never worked with HTML before (I use Dash to avoid it for my web development), so it was tricky to get the info I wanted from the parsed HTML. I figured it out eventually, though.
