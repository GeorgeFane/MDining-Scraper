This is v1 of my MDining Scraper app. v0 simply got the hours for each meal for each dining hall, which my friends helped me realize was not very useful. v1 gets all hours, checks which meal for each dining hall is open right now, and then gets all foods for that meal. It shows all foods that you could feasibly get at this instant.

This app is deployed on Heroku at https://mdining-scraper.herokuapp.com/
